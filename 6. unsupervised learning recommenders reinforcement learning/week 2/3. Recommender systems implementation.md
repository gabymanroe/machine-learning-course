**Question 2**<br>
The implementation of collaborative filtering utilized a custom training loop in TensorFlow. Is it true that TensorFlow always requires a custom training loop?
- [ ] Yes. TensorFlow gains flexibility by providing the user primitive operations they can combine in many ways.
- [x] No: TensorFlow provides simplified training operations for some applications.

**Question 3**<br>
Once a model is trained, the 'distance' between features vectors gives an indication of how similar items are. <br>
The squared distance between the two vectors x^(k) and x^(i) is:<br>

- [x] Pies and You
- [ ] Pastries for Supper

**Question 4**<br>
Which of these is an example of the cold start problem? (Check all that apply.) 
- [ ] A recommendation system is so computationally expensive that it causes your computer CPU to heat up, causing your computer to need to be cooled down and restarted. 
- [x] A recommendation system is unable to give accurate rating predictions for a new product that no users have rated. 
- [ ] A recommendation system takes so long to train that users get bored and leave. 
- [x] A recommendation system is unable to give accurate rating predictions for a new user that has rated few products.
