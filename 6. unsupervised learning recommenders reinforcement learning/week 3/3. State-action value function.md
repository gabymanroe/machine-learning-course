**Question 1**<br>
Which of the following accurately describes the state-action value function Q(s,a)? 
- [x] It is the return if you start from state s, take action a (once), then behave optimally after that. 
- [ ] It is the return if you start from state s and repeatedly take action a.
- [ ] It is the return if you start from state s and behave optimally.
- [ ] It is the immediate reward if you start from state s and take action a (once).

**Question 2**<br>
You are controlling a robot that has 3 actions: ← (left), → (right) and STOP. From a given state s, you have computed Q(s, ←) = -10, Q(s, →) = -20, Q(s, STOP) = 0.<br>
What is the optimal action to take in state s?
- [x] STOP
- [ ] ← (left)
- [ ] → (right)
- [ ] Impossible to tell

**Question 3**<br>
For this problem, γ=0.25. The diagram below shows the return and the optimal action from each state. Please compute Q(5, ←).<br>

- [x] 0.625
- [ ] 0.391 
- [ ] 1.25
- [ ] 2.5
