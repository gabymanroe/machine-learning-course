**Question 1**<br>
If you want to create your own dataset and add it to TFDS, what class do you need to override?
- [ ] DataBuilder
- [ ] DatasetBuild
- [ ] Dataset
- [x] DatasetBuilder

**Question 2**<br>
If you want your dataset to have splits such as TRAIN or VALIDATION what class do you need to use?
- [ ] FileSplitBuilder
- [ ] FileSplitter
- [ ] SplitBuilder
- [x] FileAdapterBuilder

**Question 3**<br>
What class allows you to create your own dataset, add it to TFDS, define splits, and have it generate examples from source data?
- [ ] FileAdapterBuilder
- [ ] DatasetBuilder
- [x] GeneratorBasedBuilder
- [ ] There is no single class, you have to use multiple APIs 

**Question 4**<br>
What Python script in TFDS gets you started with creating a new dataset?
- [x] create_new_dataset.py
- [ ] new_dataset.py
- [ ] create_new_tfds_dataset.py
- [ ] create_dataset.py

**Question 5**<br>
When creating a dataset using GeneratorBasedBuilder, what three methods do you need to implement?
- [x] _info(), _split_generators(), _generate_examples()
- [ ] _info(), _generate_splits(), _generate_examples()
- [ ] _info(), _split(), examples()
- [ ] _info(), _split_generators(), _examples_generators()

**Question 6**<br>
Your dataset will need to download data from the web or cloud to your user’s machine. What class in TFDS must the download and extract process go through?
- [ ] tfds.DownloadManager
- [x] tfds.download.DownloadManager
- [ ] tfds.download.Manage
- [ ] tfds.manager.Download

**Question 7**<br>
If your dataset requires extra dependencies that aren’t part of TFDS or TensorFlow, and your user doesn’t have them, how do you ensure they get installed?
- [ ] Add imports for the required dependencies to your setup.py
- [ ] Lazy load them in your setup.py
- [x] Define them in DATASET_EXTRAS as lazy loads just for your dataset
- [ ] Define them in DATASET_EXTRAS as lazy loads for all datasets

**Question 8**<br>
Where do you store citations for your dataset?
- [ ] DatasetInfo.citations
- [ ] DatasetInfo.bibtexcitation
- [x] DatasetInfo.citation
- [ ] DatasetInfo.bibtex
