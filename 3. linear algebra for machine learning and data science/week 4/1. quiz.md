The rank of T is:
- [ ] 3
- [ ] 0
- [ ] 1
- [x] 2


**Question 2**<br>
Consider the linear transformation T that maps the vectors (1,0) and (0,1) in the following manner:<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b1f7b76-64cd-4673-94da-29f6a8cfaebc)<br>
The area of the parallelogram spanned by transforming the vectors (0,1) and (1,0) is:
> 13

**Question 3**<br>
Consider the following three matrices<br>

The determinant of M1 ⋅ M2 ⋅ M3 is equal to:
> -4

**Question 4**<br>
Let M and N be two square matrices with the same size.<br>
Check all statements that are true.
- [x] If M and N are non-singular matrices, then so is M ⋅ N
- [ ] det(M+N) = det(M) + det(N).
- [ ] If M ⋅ N is singular, then M and N are singular.
- [x] If M is singular, then M ⋅ N is singular for any matrix N.

**Question 5**<br>
Let M be the following 3×3 matrix:<br>
