Hint: To find the determinant apply the formula ad−bc. A matrix of determinant 0 is singular, while a determinant different than 0 represents a complete system, thus a non-singular matrix.
- [ ] det(A)=−2. The matrix is singular.
- [ ] det(A)=2. The matrix is singular.
- [x] det(A)=2. The matrix is non-singular.
- [ ] det(A)=0. The matrix is singular.

**Question 2**<br>
Determine if this matrix has linearly dependent or independent rows.<br>

- [x] Linearly independent
- [ ] Linearly dependent
- [ ] It cannot be determined
