**Question 1**<br>
Which of the following statements is false about Graph approach?
- [ ] Faster compilation
- [x] Easier debugging
- [ ] Parallelism
- [ ] Portability

**Question 2**<br>
Which of the following statements is true for tf.cond ?
- [x] Graph execution does not support if/else statements. To replicate that effect you use tf.cond
- [ ] tf.cond is an alternative to using if/else statements in Graphs, as its execution is much faster than if/else statements.

**Question 3**<br>
Consider the following code:<br>

How do you convert both of these functions to execute in Graph mode? Check all that are true
- [x] By adding the decorator, @tf.function, only above the function definition of multiple_increment
- [ ] By adding the decorator, @tf.function, only above the function definition of increment_by_two
- [ ] By adding the decorator, @tf.autograph, above the definitions of both of the functions.
- [x] By adding the decorator, @tf.function, above the definitions of both of the functions.

**Question 4**<br>
Function written in Eager mode when converted to Graph accommodates different data types all in one, so you donâ€™t have to define similar functions for different data types.
- [ ] False
- [x] True

**Question 5**<br>
Which of the following is the correct syntax to display the auto-generated AutoGraph code if your function name is my_function?
- [x] tf.autograph.to_code(my_function.python_function)
- [ ] tf.autograph.code(my_function)
- [ ] tf.autograph.to_code(my_function)
- [ ] tf.autograph.code(my_function.python_function)

**Question 6**<br>
Consider the following code, what will be the output?<br>

- [ ] Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!
- [x] Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!
- [ ] Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!<br>
       Hello World!
