**Question 1**<br>
When using image augmentation with image_dataset_from_directory, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.
- [ ] It gets overwritten, so be sure to make a backup
- [ ] A copy is made and the augmentation is done on the copy
- [x] Nothing, all augmentation is done in-memory
- [ ] It gets deleted

**Question 2**<br>
How does image augmentation help solve overfitting?
- [ ] It slows down the training process
- [x] It manipulates the training set to generate more scenarios for features in the images
- [ ] It manipulates the validation set to generate more scenarios for features in the images
- [ ] It automatically fits features to images by finding them through image processing techniques

**Question 3**<br>
True or False: Using image augmentation effectively simulates having a larger variation of images in the training dataset.
- [ ] False
- [x] True

**Question 4**<br>
When using image augmentation, model training gets...
- [x] slower
- [ ] faster
- [ ] stays the same
- [ ] much faster

**Question 5**<br>
If my training data only has people facing left, but I want to classify people facing right, how would I avoid overfitting?
- [ ] Use the 'flip' parameter of image_dataset_from_directory and set 'horizontal'
- [ ] Use the ‘flip’ parameter of image_dataset_from_directory
- [ ] Use the RandomFlip layer and set mode='vertical'
- [x] Use the RandomFlip layer and set mode='horizontal'

**Question 6**<br>
How do you use image augmentation in TensorFLow
- [ ] With the tf.augment API
- [ ] With the keras.augment API
- [ ] You have to write a plugin to extend tf.layers
- [x] Using preprocessing layers from the Keras Layers API

**Question 7**<br>
After adding data augmentation and using the same batch size and steps per epoch, you noticed that each training epoch became a little slower than when you trained without it. Why?
- [ ] Because the augmented data is bigger
- [ ] Because there is more data to train on
- [x] Because the image preprocessing takes cycles
- [ ] Because the training is making more mistakes

**Question 8**<br>
What does the fill_mode parameter do?
- [ ] There is no fill_mode parameter
- [ ] It creates random noise in the image
- [x] It attempts to recreate lost information after a transformation like a shear
- [ ] It masks the background of an image
