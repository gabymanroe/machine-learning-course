Question 1
A scientist has six objects, three of type X and three of type Y, and wants to determine the weight of each type. The scientist decided to perform two weighings:
She weighs three X objects and one Y object and gets a total weight of 1100 grams.
She weighs one X object and three Y objects and gets a total weight of 1050 grams.
Which of the following linear systems describes the experiment above?

{ 
3x+3y=1100
3x+3y=1050
​
 



{
3
x
+
y
=
1050
x
+
3
y
=
1100
{ 
3x+y=1050
x+3y=1100
​
 



{
3
x
=
1100
3
y
=
1050
{ 
3x=1100
3y=1050
​
 



{
3
x
+
y
=
1100
x
+
3
y
=
1050
{ 
3x+y=1100
x+3y=1050
​
