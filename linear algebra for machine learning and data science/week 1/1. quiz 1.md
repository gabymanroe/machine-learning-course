Question 1
A scientist has six objects, three of type X and three of type Y, and wants to determine the weight of each type. The scientist decided to perform two weighings:
She weighs three X objects and one Y object and gets a total weight of 1100 grams.
She weighs one X object and three Y objects and gets a total weight of 1050 grams.
Which of the following linear systems describes the experiment above?

- [ ] 3x+3y=1100
      3x+3y=1050
​
- [ ] 3x+y=1050
      x+3y=1100
​
- [ ] 3x=1100
      3y=1050
​
- [x] 3x+y=1100
      x+3y=1050

​Question 2
Which of the following matrices can be used to determine the singularity of the system of equations below?
2x+3y=15
2x+4y=16
​
- [ ] 2 15
      2 16

- [ ] 3 ​15
​      4 16
​
- [ ] 2 2
      3 4

- [x] 2 3
      2 4

Each plot represents one of the systems described. Choose the correct option.

- [ ] Plot 1 represents System 3
      Plot 2 represents System 2
      Plot 3 represents System 1

- [ ] Plot 1 represents System 2
      Plot 2 represents System 1
      Plot 3 represents System 3

- [ ] Plot 1 represents System 1
      Plot 2 represents System 2
      Plot 3 represents System 3

- [ ] Plot 1 represents System 1
      Plot 2 represents System 3
      Plot 3 represents System 2

- [x] Plot 1 represents System 3
      Plot 2 represents System 1
      Plot 3 represents System 2
