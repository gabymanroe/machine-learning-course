Let M be a square matrix.<br>
Check all that are true.<br>
- [x] If det(M)=5, then det(M^n)=5^n.

Therefore, it is always positive.
- [ ] If M has size n, then it has n distinct eigenvalues.
- [x] If M is non-singular, then so is M^(-1).

**Question 7**<br>
Consider the following matrix:<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca29e6ac-450b-4fc5-aaef-cb5c9c62476d)<br>
The covariance matrix related to this matrix is:<br>
Hint: Remember you need to centralize M for each column to first get the matrix denoted in lectures as X, then use the correct formula. You may want to watch again the lecture on 
[PCA - Mathematical Formulation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/G907M/pca-mathematical-formulation).

**Question 8**<br>
Consider the following matrix<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c706512-2085-408c-b557-cb68830db3d9)<br>
Check all the options that represent the eigenvectors of this matrix.<br>
Hint: <br>
- The characteristic polynomial for M is given by (3−λ)(1−λ).
- Remember that for each eigenvalue, if there is a non-zero eigenvector related to it, then there are infinitely many more eigenvectors related to the same eigenvalue. In other words, if v is an eigenvector for an eigenvalue λ, then kv is also an eigenvector for the same eigenvalue λ, for any real valued number k.
