**Question 1**<br>
Which of the following can address overfitting?
- [x] Select a subset of the more relevant features.
- [x] Remove a random set of training examples
- [ ] Collect more training data
- [x] Apply regularization

**Question 2**<br>
You fit logistic regression with polynomial features to a dataset, and your model looks like this.<br>

What would you conclude? (Pick one)
- [x] The model has high variance (overfit). Thus, adding data is likely to help
- [ ] The model has high bias (underfit). Thus, adding data is, by itself, unlikely to help much.

Suppose you have a regularized linear regression model.  If you increase the regularization parameter Î», what do you expect to happen to the parameters w1, w2, ..., wn?
- [ ] This will increase the size of the parameters w1, w2, ..., wn
- [x] This will reduce the size of the parameters w1, w2, ..., wn
