1. For linear regression, the model is f(x) = wx+b.<br>
Which of the following are the inputs, or features, that are fed into the model and with which the model is expected to make a prediction?
- [ ] (x,y) 
- [ ] w and b.
- [x] x
- [ ] m

2. For linear regression, if you find parameters w and b so that J(w,b) is very close to zero, what can you conclude?
- [x] The selected values of the parameters w and b cause the algorithm to fit the training set really well.
- [ ] The selected values of the parameters w and b cause the algorithm to fit the training set really poorly.
- [ ] This is never possible -- there must be a bug in the code.
