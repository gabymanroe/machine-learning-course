**Question 1**<br>
One of the ways of declaring a loss function is to import its object. Is the following code correct for using a loss object?<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef353817-79c1-4c19-a803-4bc0e8880d70)
- [x] False
- [ ] True

**Question 2**<br>
It is possible to add parameters to the object call when using the loss object.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b37779a-0c95-4b6d-9679-409523a25b8a)
- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Question 3**<br>
You learned that you can do hyperparameter tuning within custom-built loss functions by creating a wrapper function around the loss function with hyperparameters defined as its parameter. What is the purpose of creating a wrapper function around the original loss function?<br>

- [ ] No particular reason, it just looks neater this way.
- [ ] Thatâ€™s one way of doing it. We can also do the same by passing y_true, y_pred and threshold as parameters to the loss function itself.
- [ ] The loss ( model.compile(..., loss = ) ) expects a function that is only a wrapper function to the loss function itself.
- [x] The loss ( model.compile(..., loss = ) ) expects a function with two parameters, y_true and y_pred, so it is not possible to pass a 3rd parameter (threshold) to the loss function itself. This can be achieved by creating a wrapper function around the original loss function.

**Question 4**<br>
One other way of implementing a custom loss function is by creating a class with two function definitions, init and call.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8d3d44-1aff-4f1f-8655-ada012ec5a43)<br>
Which of the following is correct?
- [ ] We pass the hyperparameter (threshold) , y_true and y_pred to the init function, and the call function returns the init function.
- [ ] We pass y_true and y_pred to the init function, the hyperparameter (threshold) to the call function.
- [ ] We pass the hyperparameter (threshold) , y_true and y_pred to the call function, and the init function returns the call function.
- [x] We pass the hyperparameter (threshold) to the init function, y_true and y_pred to the call function.

**Question 5**<br>
The formula for the contrastive loss, the function that is used in the siamese network for calculating image similarity, is defined as following:<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1729382d-1f5d-4c91-a05d-e2913ab44b04)
Check all that are true:
- [x] If the euclidean distance between the pair of images is low then it means the images are similar.
- [ ] Ds are 1 if images are similar, 0 if they are not.
- [x] Y is the tensor of details about image similarities.
- [ ] Margin is a constant that we use to enforce a maximum distance between the two images in order to consider them similar or different from one another.
