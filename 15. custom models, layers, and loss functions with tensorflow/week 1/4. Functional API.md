**Question 1**<br>
Which of these steps are needed for building a model with the Functional API? (Select three from the list below)<br>
1. Explicitly define an input layer to the model.<br>
2. Define the input layer of the model using any Keras layer class (e.g., Flatten(), Dense(), ...)<br>
3. Define disconnected intermediate layers of the model.<br>
4. Connect each layer using python functional syntax.<br>
5. Define the model using the input and output layers.<br>
6. Define the model using only the output layer(s).
- [ ] 2, 4, 5
- [x] 1, 4, 5
- [ ] 1, 4, 6
- [ ] 1, 3, 5

**Question 2**<br>
Is the following code correct for building a model with the Sequential API?<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d50f7d-7920-4eeb-8c6c-871208662d8f)
- [x] False
- [ ] True

**Question 3**<br>
Only a single input layer can be defined for a functional model.
- [x] False
- [ ] True

**Question 4**<br>
What are Branch Models ? 
- [ ] A model architecture with a single recurring path.
- [ ] A model architecture where you can split the model into different paths, and cannot merge them later.
- [x] A model architecture with non-linear topology, shared layers, and even multiple inputs or outputs.
- [ ] A model architecture with linear stack of layers.

**Question 5**<br>
One of the advantages of the Functional API is the option to build branched models with multiple outputs, where different loss functions can be implemented for each output.
- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Question 6**<br>
A siamese network architecture has:
- [ ] 2 inputs, 2 outputs
- [ ] 1 input, 1 output
- [x] 2 inputs, 1 output
- [ ] 1 input, 2 outputs

**Question 7**<br>
What is the output of each twin network inside a Siamese Network architecture?
- [ ] A softmax probability
- [ ] A number
- [x] An output vector
- [ ] Binary value, 1 or 0

**Question 8**<br>
What is the purpose of using a custom contrastive loss function for a siamese model? 
- [x] It is a custom built function that can calculate the loss on similarity comparison between two items.
- [ ] As a custom built function, it provides better results and it is faster to run.
- [ ] A custom loss function is required for using the RMSprop() optimizer.
- [ ] A custom built function is required because it is not possible to use a built-in loss function with the Lambda layer.
