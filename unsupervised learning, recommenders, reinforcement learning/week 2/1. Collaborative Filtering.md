**Question 3**<br>
In which of the following situations will a collaborative filtering system be the most appropriate learning algorithm (compared to linear or logistic regression)?
- [ ] You're an artist and hand-paint portraits for your clients. Each client gets a different portrait (of themselves) and gives you 1-5 star rating feedback, and each client purchases at most 1 portrait. You'd like to predict what rating your next customer will give you.
- [x] You run an online bookstore and collect the ratings of many users. You want to use this to identify what books are "similar" to each other (i.e., if a user likes a certain book, what are other books that they might also like?)
- [ ] You subscribe to an online video streaming service, and are not satisfied with their movie suggestions. You download all your viewing for the last 10 years and rate each item. You assign each item a genre. Using your ratings and genre assignment, you learn to predict how you will rate new movies based on the genre.
- [ ] You manage an online bookstore and you have the book ratings from many users. You want to learn to predict the expected sales volume (number of books sold) as a function of the average rating of a book.

**Question 4**<br>
For recommender systems with binary labels y, which of these are reasonable ways for defining when y should be 1 for a given user j and item i? (Check all that apply.) 
- [x] y is 1 if user j purchases item i (after being shown the item) 
- [ ] y is 1 if user j has been shown item i by the recommendation engine 
- [ ] y is 1 if user j has not yet been shown item i by the recommendation engine 
- [x] y is 1 if user j fav/likes/clicks on item i (after being shown the item)
