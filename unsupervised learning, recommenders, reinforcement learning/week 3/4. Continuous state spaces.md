**Question 1**<br>
The Lunar Lander is a continuous state Markov Decision Process (MDP) because:
- [ ] The state has multiple numbers rather than only a single number (such as position in the x-direction) 
- [ ] The state-action value Q(s,a) function outputs continuous valued numbers 
- [ ] The reward contains numbers that are continuous valued
- [x] The state contains numbers such as position and velocity that are continuous valued.

**Question 2**<br>
In the learning algorithm described in the videos, we repeatedly create an artificial training set to which we apply supervised learning where the input x=(s,a) and the target, constructed using Bellman’s equations, is y = _____? 
- [ ] ![Screenshot_48](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5da9d5df-ee46-4690-9264-84192ef3840a) where s′ is the state you get to after taking action a in state s
- [x] ![Screenshot_49](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8683332-84fd-4164-8a10-93fdfbe5cd90) where s′ is the state you get to after taking action a in state s 
- [ ] y = R(s′) where s′ is the state you get to after taking action a in state s 
- [ ] y = R(s)

**Question 3**<br>
You have reached the final practice quiz of this class! What does that mean? (Please check all the answers, because all of them are correct!)
- [x] The DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online teams would like to give you a round of applause! 
- [x] You deserve to celebrate!
- [x] What an accomplishment -- you made it! 
- [x] Andrew sends his heartfelt congratulations to you!
