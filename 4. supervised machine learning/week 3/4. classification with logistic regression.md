**Question 1**<br>
Which is an example of a classification task?
- [ ] Based on a patient's age and blood pressure, determine how much blood pressure medication (measured in milligrams) the patient should be prescribed.
- [x] Based on the size of each tumor, determine if each tumor is malignant (cancerous) or not.
- [ ] Based on a patient's blood pressure, determine how much blood pressure medication (a dosage measured in milligrams) the patient should be prescribed.

If z is a large positive number, then:
- [ ] g(z) is near negative one (-1) 
- [ ] g(z) will be near 0.5 
- [x] g(z) is near one (1) 
- [ ] g(z) will be near zero (0)

A cat photo classification model predicts 1 if it's a cat, and 0 if it's not a cat. For a particular photograph, the logistic regression model outputs g(z) (a number between 0 and 1). Which of these would be a reasonable criteria to decide whether to predict if itâ€™s a cat?
- [ ] Predict it is a cat if g(z) = 0.5 
- [ ] Predict it is a cat if g(z) < 0.7 
- [x] Predict it is a cat if g(z) >= 0.5 
- [ ] Predict it is a cat if g(z) < 0.5 

**Question 4**<br>
True/False? No matter what features you use (including if you use polynomial features), the decision boundary learned by logistic regression will be a linear decision boundary. 
- [x] False
- [ ] True
