**Question 1**<br>
![Screenshot_49](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd5b6ab1-54a4-46b0-9a93-43712ce90e66)<br>
Here is some code that you saw in the lecture:<br>
```
model.compile(loss=BinaryCrossentropy())
```
For which type of task would you use the binary cross entropy loss function?
- [ ] BinaryCrossentropy() should not be used for any task. 
- [x] binary classification (classification with exactly 2 classes)
- [ ] A classification task that has 3 or more classes (categories)
- [ ] regression tasks (tasks that predict a number)

**Question 2**<br>
![Screenshot_51](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ae6f60c-b6c1-4932-ab3b-4dce91fe5e57)<br>
Here is code that you saw in the lecture:<br>
```
model = Sequential([
Dense(units=25, activation='sigmoid’),
Dense(units=15, activation='sigmoid’),
Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid’)
])
model.compile(loss=BinaryCrossentropy())
model.fit(X,y,epochs=100)
```
Which line of code updates the network parameters in order to reduce the cost?
- [ ] None of the above -- this code does not update the network parameters. 
- [x] model.fit(X,y,epochs=100)
- [ ] model = Sequential([...]) 
- [ ] model.compile(loss=BinaryCrossentropy())
