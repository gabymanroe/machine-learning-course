**Question 1**<br>
According to the lecture, how do you calculate the activation of the third neuron in the first layer using NumPy?<br>

- [x] z1_3 = np.dot(w1_3, x) + b1_3<br>
      a1_3 = sigmoid(z1_3)
- [ ] z1_3 =w1_3 * x + b<br>
      a1_3 = sigmoid(z1_3)
- [ ] layer_1 = Dense(units=3, activation='sigmoid')<br>
      a_1 = layer_1(x)

**Question 2**<br>
According to the lecture, when coding up the numpy array W, where would you place the w parameters for each neuron?
- [ ] In the rows of W.
- [x] In the columns of W.

**Question 3**<br>

For the code above in the "dense" function that defines a single layer of neurons, how many times does the code go through the "for loop"? Note that W has 2 rows and 3 columns.
- [ ] 2 times
- [ ] 5 times 
- [x] 3 times
- [ ] 6 times
