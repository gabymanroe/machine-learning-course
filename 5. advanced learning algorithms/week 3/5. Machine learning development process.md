Which of these is a way to do error analysis? 
- [ ] Calculating the training error J_(train)
- [ ] Collecting additional training data in order to help the algorithm do better. 
- [x] Manually examine a sample of the training examples that the model misclassified in order to identify common traits and trends. 
- [ ] Calculating the test error J_(test)<br>

We sometimes take an existing training example and modify it (for example, by rotating an image slightly) to create a new example with the same label. What is this process called?
- [x] Data augmentation 
- [ ] Error analysis
- [ ] Bias/variance analysis 
- [ ] Machine learning diagnostic

What are two possible ways to perform transfer learning? Hint: two of the four choices are correct.
- [x] You can choose to train all parameters of the model, including the output layers, as well as the earlier layers.
- [ ] Given a dataset, pre-train and then further fine tune a neural network on the same dataset. 
- [ ] Download a pre-trained model and use it for prediction without modifying or re-training it. 
- [x] You can choose to train just the output layers' parameters and leave the other parameters of the model fixed.
