Take a decision tree learning to classify between spam and non-spam email. There are 20 training examples at the root note, comprising 10 spam and 10 non-spam emails. If the algorithm can choose from among four features, resulting in four corresponding splits, which would it choose (i.e., which has highest purity)? 
- [x] Left split: 10 of 10 emails are spam. Right split: 0 of 10 emails are spam. 
- [ ] Left split: 2 of 2 emails are spam. Right split: 8 of 18 emails are spam. 
- [ ] Left split: 7 of 8 emails are spam. Right split: 3 of 12 emails are spam. 
- [ ] Left split: 5 of 10 emails are spam. Right split: 5 of 10 emails are spam.
