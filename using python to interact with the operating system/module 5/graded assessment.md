- [ ] To identify unnecessary features
- [ ] To prove the software works correctly
- [x] To make sure the software meets the specified requirements

**Question 6**<br>
When referring to unit testing, what are “classes”? 
- [ ] Classes are individual units of testing that checks for a specific response to inputs. 
- [ ] Classes are test cases that correct bugs.
- [ ] Classes allow Python files to access scripts from another Python file.
- [x] Classes bundle data and functionality together.
