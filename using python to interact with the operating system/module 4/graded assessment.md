- [ ] Use the local Terminal application to connect using a PEM key.
- [ ] Add Secure Shell to the Chrome browser and enter the VM's hostname.
- [x] Download the PPK key file from the Qwiklabs Start Lab page and use PuTTY for SSH connection.

**Question 2**<br>
What is the primary purpose of the sys module in Python?
- [x] Provides functions and variables to interact with the Python interpreter and the runtime environment
- [ ] Mathematical and numerical computations in Python
- [ ] Creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python
- [ ] Performing system-level operations like managing files and directories

**Question 3**<br>
What is the primary function of regular expressions (RegEx) in Python programming?
- [ ] To serve as a method for encrypting and securing data within a program
- [ ] To speed up the execution of code by optimizing algorithm performance
- [ ] To act as a programming language for creating complex software applications
- [x] To define a sequence of characters that form a search pattern for text processing

**Question 4**<br>
What is the role of fishy.log in the provided Python script for log file analysis?
- [ ] It refers to a function within the script that generates log files for testing.
- [x] It is the log file that is being analyzed for specific error patterns.
- [ ] It is the name of the script that contains the regular expressions for error analysis.
- [ ] This is a configuration file that dictates how the script should process logs.

**Question 5**<br>
What role does the if __name__ == "__main__": block play in the execution of the lab’s script, and at what point in the script's execution does it come into play?
- [ ] The if __name__ == "__main__": block is responsible for defining custom functions within the script, and it runs at the beginning of the script's execution.
- [ ] The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to specify the author's name and copyright information for the script, and it runs at the end of the script.
- [x] The if __name__ == "__main__": block serves as the main entry point of the script, and it is where the script's execution begins when run as the main program.
- [ ] The if __name__ == "__main__": block handles syntax errors and runs only if an error is encountered during the script's execution.

**Question 6**<br>
Based on the Python script provided for log file analysis, what type of information would you expect to find in the errors_found.log file?
- [x] Specific error logs that match the user-defined search criteria
- [ ] Configuration settings and preferences for the system
- [ ] A summary of general system performance metrics
- [ ] A list of all users who have accessed the system

**Question 7**<br>
What is the function that takes the errors returned by another function as a formal parameter? 
- [ ] Either file_output or error_search are used for this task.
- [x] file_output
- [ ] error_search
- [ ] returned_errors

**Question 8**<br>
Which of the following statements about log files is true? Select all that apply.
- [x] They can help in identifying and fixing issues.
- [x] They can be programmed to record specific events.
- [x] They can be used to monitor system performance.
- [ ] They are created only when an error occurs.

**Question 9**<br>
What is the primary purpose of the re module in Python?
- [ ] For data encryption and cybersecurity purposes
- [ ] To enhance graphical capabilities and user interface design
- [x] To provide support for working with Regular Expressions for pattern matching in strings
- [ ] To enable network connectivity and communication over the internet

**Question 10**<br>
Apply what you’ve learned from this lab to answer this question. You are working on the find_error.py script to search for specific errors in the fishy.log file. 
If you need to find all instances of a network connection failure, which of the following steps would you take to modify the script accordingly?
- [ ] Change the error_patterns list to include only "network" and "failure", and then run the script with fishy.log.
- [ ] Edit the file_output function to filter out all logs except those containing the word "network".
- [ ] Rewrite the Regular Expression in the script to only match logs with the word "network".
- [x] Modify the user input line to specifically ask for "network connection failure" errors, then process fishy.log.
