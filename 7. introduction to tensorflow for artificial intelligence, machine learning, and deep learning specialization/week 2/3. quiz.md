**Question 1**<br>
What is the purpose of a test set? Select the best answer.
- [ ] To make testing quicker
- [ ] To train a network with previously unseen data
- [ ] To make training quicker.
- [x] To see how well the model does on previously unseen data.

**Question 2**<br>
What does the ReLU activation function do?
- [x] It returns x if x is greater than zero, otherwise it returns zero.
- [ ] For a value x, it returns 1/x.
- [ ] It returns the negative of x.
- [ ] It returns x if x is less than zero, otherwise it returns zero.

**Question 3**<br>
What is the resolution and color format of the Fashion MNIST dataset?
- [ ] 82x82 grayscale
- [x] 28x28 grayscale
- [ ] 100x100 RGB
- [ ] 28x28 RGB

**Question 4**<br>
How do you specify a callback function that activates during training?
- [ ] You pass it to the callbacks parameter in the .compile() method.
- [ ] You define it as one of the layers in your model.
- [x] You pass it to the callbacks parameter of the .fit() method.

**Question 5**<br>
True or False: You can use the on_epoch_end method to get the current state of training at the end of every epoch.
- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Question 6**<br>
Why are there 10 output neurons in the Fashion MNIST computer vision model?
- [ ] To make it train 10x faster.
- [ ] Purely arbitrary.
- [x] There are 10 different labels.
- [ ] To make it classify 10x faster.
