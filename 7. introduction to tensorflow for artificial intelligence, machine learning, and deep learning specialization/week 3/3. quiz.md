**Question 1**<br>
What does the pooling technique do to the images?
- [ ] Isolates features in them.
- [ ] Combines them.
- [x] Reduces information in them while maintaining important spatial features.
- [ ] Makes them sharper.

**Question 2**<br>
After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, the output will be 56x56
- [x] False
- [ ] True

**Question 3**<br>
How do convolutions improve image recognition?
- [x] They capture spatial features in images
- [ ] They make processing of images faster
- [ ] They make the image clearer
- [ ] They make the image smaller

**Question 4**<br>
True or  False. If you pass a 28x28 image through a 3x3 filter the output will be 26x26
- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Question 5**<br>
How does using convolutions in neural networks impact training? Select the best answer.
- [ ] It makes it faster.
- [ ] It does not affect training.
- [ ] It makes it slower.
- [x] Its impact will depend on several factors.
