1. Why is it important to be very precise about what a computer program is supposed to do?
- [x] Computers do exactly what they are told.
- [ ] If a program is not clear, it’s called a script.
- [ ] A program won’t work if there are any logic errors.
- [ ] The computer will find any loopholes it can.

2. What is a function?
- [x] A reusable block of code that performs a specific task
- [ ] A document describing a software project
- [ ] The task a program is written to accomplish
- [ ] The beginning of a program defining who wrote it and why

3. What is automation?
- [ ] The inputs and outputs of a program 
- [x] The process of replacing a manual step with an automated step
- [ ] The rules of a programming language 
- [ ] The process of designing a solution to a problem

4. What is the difference between syntax and semantics in a programming language?
- [x] Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed. Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements. 
- [ ] Syntax is the effect the instructions have on the system and semantics are how to write the instructions.
- [ ] Syntax is the tool that executes a computer program and semantics is the development environment.
- [ ] Syntax refers to computer programs and semantics is another word for scripts. 

5. Which of the following are characteristics of the Python language? Select all that apply.
- [x] Python is cross-platform compatible
- [x] Python is used in a wide variety of applications
- [ ] Python has many platform-specific tools, like Bash or Powershell
- [ ] Python is an object-oriented language not fit for general purpose scripting

6. Complete the code so that the string "I am writing Python code!" will print to the screen. Remember that syntax precision is important in programming languages. 
A missing capital letter, spelling error, or punctuation mark can produce errors.
```
# Replace the blanks with the correct code and syntax:
print("I am writing Python code!")
# Should print: I am writing Python code!
```

7. What should be the output of the expression below? 
```
print((9-3)/(2*(1+2)))
```
- [x] 1.0
- [ ] 0.28
- [ ] 19.36
- [ ] 49.0

8. Keeping in mind there are 60 seconds per minute , write a program that calculates how many seconds there are in an hour .Print the result to the screen. Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence.
```
# Enter code here:
seconds = 60
seconds_in_an_hour = 60*seconds
print(seconds_in_an_hour)
# Should print 3600
```

9. The market is six miles away from your home. The school is two miles away from your home. Use Python to calculate how much further the market is from your home than the school (in miles). Note: Your result should be in the format of a number, not a sentence.
```
# Should print 4
market = 6 
school = 2
market_from_home = market - school
print(market_from_home)
```

10. Consider this scenario about using Python to make calculations:
On a college campus, there are 30 computers in each of the 20 computer labs that are spread across campus.  The computers have a life cycle where they are replaced every five  years. One-fifth of the computers are replaced each year. 
Fill in the blank to calculate the number of computers that are replaced each year by dividing the total computers by the replacement cycle. Note: Your result should be a number. 
```
total_computers = 30*20
replacement_cycle = 5
computers_per_year = 1/5*total_computers

print(computers_per_year) # Should print 120.0
```
