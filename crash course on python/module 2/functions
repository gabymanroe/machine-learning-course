1. The function in the code below converts kilometers (km) to meters (m). In this exercise, you'll edit the code to:
Complete the function so it returns the result of the conversion. 
Call the function to convert the trip distance from kilometers to meters.
Print a text string display the result of the conversion.
NOTE: As you edit this code, do not change the indentation. If you do, it might return an error.
# 1) Complete the code to return the result of the conversion
def convert_distance(km):
	m = km * 1000  # exactly 1000 meters in 1 kilometer
	return (m)

# Do not indent any of the following lines of code as they are
# meant to be located outside of the function above

my_trip_kilometers = 55

# 2) Convert my_trip_kilometers to meters by calling the function above
my_trip_meters = convert_distance(my_trip_kilometers)

# 3) Fill in the blank to print the result of converting my_trip_kilometers
print("The distance in meters is " + str(my_trip_meters))

2. Which of the following are good coding style habits?
- [x] Adding comments (Adding comments is part of creating self-documenting code. Using comments allows you to leave notes to yourself and/or other programmers to make the purpose of the code clear.)
- [x] Writing self-documenting code (Writing self-documenting code is also called refactoring the code. Refactoring should make the intent of the code clear.)
- [x] Cleaning up duplicate code by creating a function that can be reused (You can combine duplicate code in one reusable function to make the code easier to read.)
- [ ] Using single character variable names

3. What are the values passed into functions as input called?
- [ ] Variables
- [ ] Return values
- [x] Parameters (A parameter, also sometimes called an argument, is a value passed into a function for use within the function.)
- [ ] Data types

4.Complete the first line of the “print_seconds” function so that it accepts three parameters: hours, minutes, and seconds. 
Remember, to define a function, you use the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. 
The function parameters go inside the parentheses in the function definition, and they represent the values that will be given to the function when it is called. 
Also remember that the print function is a built-in Python function that outputs its arguments to the console. 
You call a function by using its name followed by parentheses, with the arguments for the function inside the parentheses.
def print_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
   print(hours*3600+minutes*60+seconds)

print_seconds(1,2,3)
#output will print to the screen

5. What is the purpose of the def keyword?
- [x] Used to define a new function
- [ ] Used to define a return value
- [ ] Used to define a new variable
- [ ] Used to define a new parameter
