**Question 1**<br>
Fill in the blank using a for loop. With the given list of "filenames", this code should rename all files with the extension .hpp to the extension .h. 
The code  should then generate a new list called "new_filenames" that contains the file names with the new extension.
You are given a list of filenames like this:
`filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]`
Output the list with all of the “.hpp” files renamed to “.h”. Leave the other filenames alone. For this question, you must use a for loop to create the list. 
```
filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate new_filenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.

new_filenames = []
for filename in filenames:
    if filename.endswith("hpp"):
        new = filename.replace("hpp", "h")
        new_filenames.append(new)
    else:
        new_filenames.append(filename)

print(new_filenames)
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
```

**Question 2**<br>
Fill in the blank using a list comprehension. With the given list of "filenames", this code should rename all files with the extension .hpp to the extension .h. 
The code function should then generate a new list called "new_filenames" that contains the filenames with the new extension.
You are given a list of filenames like this:
`filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]`
Output the list with all of the “.hpp” files renamed to “.h”. Leave the other filenames alone. For this question, you must use list comprehension to create the list. 
```
filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate new_filenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
new_filenames = [filename.replace("hpp", "h") if filename[-3:] == "hpp" else filename for filename in filenames]  # Start your code here

print(new_filenames) 
# Should print ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
```

**Question 3**<br>
Create a function that turns text into pig latin. Pig latin is a simple text transformation that modifies each word by:
1. moving the first character to the end of each word;
2. then appending the letters "ay" to the end of each word.
For example, python ends up as ythonpay.
```
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  # Separate the text into words
  words = text.split()
  for word in words:
    # Create the pig latin word and add it to the list
    say += word[1:] + word[0] + "ay" + " " 
    # Turn the list back into a phrase
  return say
    
print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

**Question 4**<br>
Which list method can be used to add a new element to a list at a specified index position?
- [ ] list.pop(index)
- [x] list.insert(index, x)
- [ ] list.add(index, x)
- [ ] list.append(x)

**Question 5**<br>
Tuples and lists are very similar types of sequences. What is the main thing that makes a tuple different from a list?
- [ ] A tuple is mutable
- [ ] A tuple contains only numeric characters
- [x] A tuple is immutable
- [ ] A tuple can contain only one type of data at a time

**Question 6**<br>
Fill in the blanks to complete the “biography_list” function. The “biography_list” function reads in a list of tuples “people”, which contains the name, age, 
and profession of each “person”. Then, prints the sentence "__ is _ years old and works as __.". For example, “biography_list([("Ira", 30, "a Chef")])” 
should print: “Ira is 30 years old and works as a Chef.” 
```
def biography_list(people):
    # Iterate over each "person" in the given "people" list of tuples. 
    for person in people:

        # Separate the 3 items in each tuple into 3 variables:
        # "name", "age", and "profession"   
        name, age, profession = person

        # Format the required sentence and place the 3 variables 
        # in the correct placeholders using the .format() method.
        print("{} is {} years old and works as {}".format(name, age, profession))

# Call to the function:
biography_list([("Ira", 30, "a Chef"), ("Raj", 35, "a Lawyer"), ("Maria", 25, "an Engineer")])

# Click Run to submit code
# Output should match:
# Ira is 30 years old and works as a Chef
# Raj is 35 years old and works as a Lawyer
# Maria is 25 years old and works as an Engineer
```
