**Question 1**<br>
What HTML5 tag is used to show the contents of a webcam?
- [ ] `<webcam>`
- [x] `<video>`
- [ ] `<pre>`
- [ ] `<div>`

**Question 2**<br>
If I initialize a webcam object like this:<br>
`const webcam = new Webcam(document.getElementById('wc'));`<br>
Which code will then start the webcam feed to render in the page?
- [ ] async function init(){await webcam.go();}async function init(){await webcam.go();}
- [ ] async function init(){await webcam.start();}
- [x] async function init(){await webcam.setup();}
- [ ] async function init(){await webcam.initialize();}

**Question 3**<br>
If I want to create a model that uses transfer learning, with everything in mobilenet up to layer ‘foo’, and my layers afterwards, how do I do it? Assume this code was used to find layer ‘foo’<br>
`const layer = mobilenet.getLayer('foo');`
- [ ] return tf.model({inputs: mobilenet, outputs: layer});
- [ ] return tf.model({inputs: mobilenet.input, outputs: layer.outputs});
- [x] return tf.model({inputs: mobilenet.inputs, outputs: layer.output});
- [ ] return tf.model({inputs: mobilenet.inputs, outputs: layer.outputs});

**Question 4**<br>
If I am transfer learning from a mobilenet, and I want to use my own dense layers after the mobilenet ones, what is the correct syntax to use at <INSERT CODE HERE>
```
model = tf.sequential({
    layers: [
      tf.layers.flatten(<INSERT CODE HERE>),
      tf.layers.dense({ units: 100, activation: 'relu'}),
      tf.layers.dense({ units: 3, activation: 'softmax'})
    ]
  });
```
- [ ] {inputShape: mobilenet.outputs[1].shape.slice(0)}
- [x] {inputShape: mobilenet.outputs[0].shape.slice(1)}
- [ ] {inputShape: mobilenet.outputs[1].slice(0)}
- [ ] {inputShape: mobilenet.outputs[0].slice(1)}

**Question 5**<br>
If I am using a mobilenet with my own DNN for transfer learning in TensorFLow.js, how do I get a prediction for an image?
- [ ] Get a set of prediction embeddings from your model and pass them to mobilenet
- [x] Get a set of prediction embeddings from mobilenet and pass them to your model
- [ ] Just pass the prediction to your own model, it already includes the mobilenet layers
- [ ] Just pass the prediction to mobilenet, because you’ve already added your layers to it

**Question 6**<br>
If you have a set of predictions returned from model.predict(something) and you want to take the one with the largest probability, how do you do it? 
- [ ] predictions[0] contains the one with the largest probability
- [ ] predictions.sort() then look at the 0th element
- [ ] predictions.argMax() then look at the 0th element
- [x] predictions.as1D().argMax(), then look at the 0th element

**Question 7**<br>
If you already have a function called predict() in a class called ‘foo’  which captures a frame from the webcam and predicts it, what’s the best way to call it, particularly if you plan to do continuous predictions?
- [ ] foo.predict(tf.tidy());
- [ ] tf.tidy(foo.predict());
- [ ] foo.predict(); tf.tidy();
- [x] tf.tidy(() => foo.predict());

**Question 8**<br>
Why is transfer learning a huge advantage, particularly when training in the browser?
- [ ] It allows you to use already-learned convolutions for distinguishing features, saving space
- [ ] It lets you skip training altogether
- [x] It allows you to use already-learned convolutions for distinguishing features, saving training time
- [ ] It gives you a smaller model
